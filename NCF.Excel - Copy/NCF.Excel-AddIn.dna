       The RuntimeVersion attribute above allows two settings:
       * RuntimeVersion="v2.0" - for .NET 2.0, 3.0 and 3.5
       * RuntimeVersion="v4.0" - for .NET 4 and 4.5

       Additional referenced assemblies can be specified by adding 'Reference' tags. 
       These libraries will not be examined and registered with Excel as add-in libraries, 
       but will be packed into the -packed.xll file and loaded at runtime as needed.
       For example:
       
       <Reference Path="Another.Library.dll" Pack="true" />
  
       Excel-DNA also allows the xml for ribbon UI extensions to be specified in the .dna file.
       See the main Excel-DNA site at http://excel-dna.net for downloads of the full distribution.
